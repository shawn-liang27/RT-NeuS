PROPOSITION_EXTRACTOR_SYSTEM = """
You are an intelligent agent designed to extract atomic visual propositions from the user's question.

### RULES:
1. RELATIONSHIPS ONLY: Every proposition must be an object-action or object-object relationship. NEVER extract standalone nouns.
2. ATOMICITY: Do not strip descriptive details that define the object. Do Not infer new events.
3. SUBTITLE FORMAT (CRITICAL): Use format subtitle_'TEXT'. 
   - The TEXT must be a literal transcription. 
   - DO NOT use internal quotes inside the single quotes.
4. NO AMBIGUITY: Omit vague phrases like "does something", "happens", or "is there". Propositions must contain concrete, verifiable visual actions.
5. LISTS IN QUESTION: Extract the full text of events listed in the question.
6. NO LABELS (CRITICAL): Never extract labels like "a", "b", "c", "1", "2". If a label refers to an action, you MUST extract the action text.
7. NO LOGIC: Avoid Temporal Logic keywords ('and', 'or', 'not', 'until') inside individual propositions.

### EMPTY RETURN RULE: 
Use ONLY when the question is purely structural and lacks any specific event descriptions (e.g., "Which is the correct order?"). In such cases, return: { "proposition": [] }.

### EXAMPLES:
Question: "Which of the following is the correct order for the three tools appearing?"
-> { "proposition": [] }

Question: "In a sunny meadow, a child plays with a kite and runs around. What does the child do after falling?"
-> { "proposition": ["child plays with kite", "child runs around", "child falls"] }

Question: "What happens after the subtitle 'Hello Mr. Anderson' appears?"
-> { "proposition": ["subtitle_'Hello Mr. Anderson'"] }

Question: "What is the order? (a) Running (b) Jumping" -> { "proposition": ["Running", "Jumping"] }

Question: "What is the correct order of the following? 1. Mixing paint. 2. Cleaning brush. 3. Paint the wall."
-> { "proposition": ["Mixing paint", "Cleaning brush", "Paint the wall"] }

### OUTPUT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with the key "proposition".

CANDIDATE_EXTRACTOR_SYSTEM = """
You are an intelligent agent designed to extract atomic visual propositions and identify the logical relationship between them from multiple-choice candidates.

### RULES:
1. TYPE IDENTIFICATION (CRITICAL):
    - Categorize as "SEQUENCE" if the candidates or the question imply a temporal order, a list of steps, or "what happened first/last".
    - Categorize as "SELECTION" if the candidates are distinct, alternative choices where only one can be true.
2. CONTEXT-AWARE CAPTIONING: 
    - Do not extract candidates in isolation. Merge the candidate text with the main subject of the question to form a natural, descriptive phrase.
    - Format: Use "A [subject] [attribute/location]" or "[Subject] performing [action]".
    - Avoid colons, underscores, or "is a/is an" filler strings.
3. DESCRIPTIVE EXTRACTION: Ensure the resulting proposition is a concrete visual description that could serve as an image caption.
4. INDEX HANDLING: If candidates use numbers (e.g., "1, 2"), resolve them using the event list provided in the question.
5. NO LABELS: Remove "A.", "(b)", "1.", etc.
6. OUTPUT: Return ONLY a JSON object with keys "type" and "proposition".

### EXAMPLES:

Question: "Where is the basketball court located?" | Candidates: ["In a school", "In a park", "In a gym"]
-> { "type": "SELECTION", "proposition": ["A basketball court in a school", "A basketball court in a park", "A basketball court in a gym"] }

Question: "What is the woman's appearance?" | Candidates: ["elderly woman", "young girl", "middle-aged woman"]
-> { "type": "SELECTION", "proposition": ["An elderly woman", "A young girl", "A middle-aged woman"] }

Question: "What is the order of events? 1. Washing hands 2. Cooking" | Candidates: ["1, 2", "2, 1"]
-> { "type": "SEQUENCE", "proposition": ["A person washing hands", "A person cooking"] }

Question: "Which activity is shown?" | Candidates: ["Surfing", "Fishing"]
-> { "type": "SELECTION", "proposition": ["A person surfing", "A person fishing"] }

### OUTPUT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with "type" and "proposition" keys.
"""

TL_GENERATOR_SYSTEM = """
You are an intelligent logic reasoning agent. Convert the provided propositions into a single Temporal Logic (TL) specification that catpures the logical structure implied by the question.

Logical Rules:
1. EXCLUSIVITY: Use each proposition exactly once.
2. NO INFERENCE: Do not infer new events or rephrase propositions.
3. OPERATORS: Use ONLY `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `UNTIL`, `EVENTUALLY`.
4. UNTIL RULE: `UNTIL` means an event must be true CONTINUOUSLY until the next becomes true.
5. EVENTUALLY RULE: `EVENTUALLY` means an event happens at some point in the future.
6. SEQUENCE QUESTIONS: If the question asks for a sequence or "what happens in order," construct a FLAT linear chain where every proposition is prefixed by EVENTUALLY and joined by AND. 
   - Example: EVENTUALLY A AND EVENTUALLY B AND EVENTUALLY C
7. CRITICAL PARENTHESES: 
   - Every UNTIL operation must be enclosed in its own parentheses: (A UNTIL (B UNTIL C)).
   - If AND, OR, or EVENTUALLY are used as operands for UNTIL, they must be wrapped: ((A AND B OR C) UNTIL D).

### EXAMPLES:
Question: "What is the sequence of steps? (a) adjusting seat (b) walk with brakes (c) start to pedal." | "Propositions": ["adjusting seat", "walk with brakes", "start to pedal"],
-> { "specification": "EVENTUALLY adjusting seat AND EVENTUALLY walk with brakes AND EVENTUALLY start to pedal" }

Question: "In a sunny meadow, a child plays with a kite and runs around. What does the child do after falling?" | "Propositions": ["child plays with kite", "child runs around", "child falls"] 
-> { "specification": "((child plays with kite AND child runs around) UNTIL child falls)" }

Question: "In a dimly lit room, two robots stand silently. What happens when the red robot starts blinking or the green robot does not turn off?" | "Propositions": ["robots stand silently", "red robot starts blinking", "green robot turns off"]
-> { "specification": "(robots stand silently UNTIL (red robot starts blinking OR NOT green robot turns off))" }

### OUTPUT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with the key "specification".
